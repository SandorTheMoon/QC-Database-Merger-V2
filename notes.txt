1. Create requirements.txt to list all required packages/libraries to be installed.
2. Create a .BAT file. Executes the program in one click.
   - Create a separate script for installing Python first. 
   - Check if all required packages are installed.
   - Check if MergedFiles2 folder does not exist, create one.
   - Display the progress of every step in the .BAT file (if possible).
        Example:
           "Installing Packages..."
           "Finished installing packages"
           "Running the program..."
           "Finished running the program"
           "Program has stopped/closed"


3. Create a venv (Virtual Environment) to put installed packages.
   - To prevent the program from installing the packages/libraries directly to their computer.

4. Added exit() after executing the program to prevent re-running errors.
5. Try Except errors to processes in order to prevent.
